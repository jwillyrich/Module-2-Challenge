# Module-2-Challenge

**1. Overview of Project**

In this challenge I am performing a Stock Analysis for stocks with tickers : AY, CSIG, DQ, ENPH, FSLR, HASI, JKS, RUN, SEDG, SPWR, TERP, VSLR. Steve loved the workbook I prepared for him. Now his parents want us to do a little more research to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market. For this we used VBA with an excel file that had data for each ticker that was used to perform the analysis. We calculated the Total Daily Value and the Annual Return for each of the 12 stocks in this data. With that, we can determinate which stocks in this data performed from best to worst.

2. Results
Explain the purpose of this analysis

the purpose of this analysis was to write code to loop through all the data for the years (2018 and 2017) and get the information needed (the total daily volume of each stock and annual return ) With this code we have created created  four different arrays -  tickers (for each stock) , tickerVolumes ,tickerStartingPrices and tickerEndingPrices and we used tickerIndex to match the arrays with the tickers .

2. Summary

After the analysis, we found that only two stocks had positive return. The rest all had a negative return. For the total daily Volume return all but one had a negative return. With the information we returned from the analysis, Steve's parents can make an informed decision on which stocks to invest in.
